Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

      They are a financial consulting company. They want to modernize their custom software by        incorporating the latest and most secure software security solutions

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

     We were able to implement the desired software solutions. For example, we added proper checksum file verification to ensure file integrity

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

      The hardest part involved documenting all the existing vulnerabilities

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

      It is important to understand the type of industry your application will be operating in. Different applications, like financial applications, will be more prone to attacks - due to its value. With that analysis, one could decide the amount of security layers to add to their application

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

      by ensuring the application runs properly requires compiling and running the application

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

      The use of the Dependency Check tool will assist in implementing secure dependencies into a project - or at least the most secure.
      

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

    I would be to showcase my ability to understand requirements, assess security vulnerabilities, and implement proper mitigating solutions.
